# Analysis of Dataset on Facebook Live Sales Interactions in Thailand

## Project Overview
The "Analysis of Dataset on Facebook Live Sales Interactions in Thailand" project aims to analyze big data related to interactions on Facebook Live sales posts in Thailand. Using the dataset named "Facebook Live sellers in Thailand, UCI ML Repo" from Kaggle, it focuses on analyzing the interactions of posts related to online sales on Facebook Live, which is a popular platform for live-streaming sales events in Thailand. The analysis aims to understand patterns and behaviors associated with these live commerce activities.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Facebook Live sellers in Thailand, UCI ML Repo" dataset available on Kaggle. It contains information about Facebook Live sales posts in Thailand, including variables such as `status_id`, `status_type`, `status_published`, `num_reactions`, `num_comments`, `num_shares`, and more.

## Methodology
To analyze the dataset, the following approach is taken:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - The data preprocessing technique used is the label encoder, which converts string data to float data, removing columns that do not contribute to the analysis and extracting valuable values from the original columns.

2. **Machine Learning Algorithm**:
   - The data mining algorithm chosen for this project is Linear Regression, a popular machine learning algorithm that models the relationship between the dataset variables.

3. **Analysis and Insights**:
   - Using the Linear Regression model, the project aims to uncover patterns and behaviors associated with Facebook Live sales interactions in Thailand, such as the relationship between the number of reactions, comments, shares, and other relevant variables.

## Expected Outcomes
The expected outcomes of this project include:

1. Gaining insights into the interactions and engagement patterns on Facebook Live sales posts in Thailand.
2. Identifying key factors that influence the success of live commerce activities on the platform.
3. Providing recommendations for businesses and marketers to optimize their Facebook Live sales strategies based on the analysis.
